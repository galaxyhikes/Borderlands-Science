Citizen science games represent a platform for scalable data annotation, however, their long-term viability hinges on understanding and maintaining player engagement. This study analyses player behaviour in Borderlands Science, a citizen science game embedded within a commercial video game, Borderlands 3, to identify factors driving long-term participation. Using a combination of survival analysis and K-means
clustering on player activity data, three distinct behavioural archetypes were identified: Speedrunners, Completionists, and Explorers. The results demonstrate that in-game behaviours such as performance consistency and session intensity influence player longevity differently depending on the player’s underlying archetype. These findings challenge one-size-fits-all engagement models and lay the foundation for designing targeted interventions to reduce churn and improve the productivity of citizen science platforms.
